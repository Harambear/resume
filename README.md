# resume
Static resume webpage featuring vanilla HTML, Sassy CSS, and JavaScript.

This project is a static webpage, able to reproduce in any environment with the files included.

The current version is hosted on GitHub https://kijung.kim.

This project was built with primitive tools just to keep in touch with my roots.

Once MVP is made, the project will be forked and saved in a separate repository.
This project will then be rewritten in a modern frontend framework and optimized for performance.
Most likely will use React for its light-weight framework.
